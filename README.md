# Ludo
Ludo is a classic board game, originating from India, that can be played by 4 players. The objective is to move all of your pieces from the start to the center of the board, overcoming obstacles and potentially sending your opponents' pieces back to their starting position. It is a game of both strategy and chance, with players rolling dice to determine their moves.

 **Components**:
  - 1 game board (square-shaped with a cross-shaped path for movement)
  - 4 tokens per player
  - 2 die (6 faces numbered 1 to 6 for each die)
- **Goal**: To move all four tokens to the center of the board before your opponents.

## Game Rules

1. **Starting the Game**:
   - Each player selects a color and places their four tokens in the corresponding colored starting area.
   - Players take turns rolling the die. To move a token out of the starting area, a player must roll a 6.
   - If a player rolls a 6, they may roll again.

2. **Movement**:
   - Players take turns rolling the die and moving one of their tokens forward according to the number rolled.
   - Tokens move along the track, following a specific path for each player.

3. **Sending Opponents Back**:
   - If a player's token lands on a space occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent’s token is sent back to its starting area.
   - The player who landed on the opponent’s token gets another turn.

4. **Entering the Home Area**:
   - Once a token has completed a full loop around the board, it must enter the home area (center of the board) by exact dice roll.
   - A player cannot move a token into their home area unless they roll the exact number needed to land in the center.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to move all their tokens to the center (home area) wins the game.
   - Other players continue until all tokens are home or until they are knocked out.

## Strategy Tips

- **Use 6 wisely**: Rolling a 6 allows you to get a new piece into play, but be mindful of the consequences of leaving pieces exposed to being sent back.
- **Block opponents**: Try to block your opponents by occupying key spots on the path, especially if they are about to pass.
- **Plan your moves**: Think ahead to maximize your turns and avoid sending your pieces to the starting area.
